## Updating Package Version

1. To change the version number in `package.json`, on the command line, in the package root directory, run the following command, replacing `<update_type>` with one of the semantic versioning release types (patch, major, or minor):

`npm version <update_type>`

2. Run `npm publish`.

3. Go to your package page (`https://npmjs.com/package/<package>`) to check that the package version has been updated.
